Watershed-Project
===============

Intro:  
“WNC Milers” is a new project proposed by the Watershed Nature Center.  
The goal of the project is to give the Watershed Nature Center a better 
idea of how their park is being used and to further encourage individuals 
to visit.  This is to be done by means of personal accounts that allow 
individuals to track dates and times of visits, track and record distances 
traveled.  There is also the proposed idea of the possible development of a 
social networking type web application where users can record progress in a 
journal and provide place to post photographs.
