Watershed-Project
===============
Intro:
Watershed Nature Center Milers (WNC Milers) is a new project proposed by the Nature Preserve Foundation, Inc. (NPF).  The goal of the project is to give the Nature Preserve Foundation, Inc. a better idea of how the Watershed Nature Center of Edwardsville, IL is being used and to further encourage individuals to visit.  


Problem Executive Summary:
The Nature Preserve Foundation, Inc. currently has no methods for tracking visits or usage of the Watershed Nature Center.  Their goal is to promote use of the park and encourage overall wellness of the general public.  The only current method for checking membership status of a visitor is double checking a list.  They would also like to obtain the information necessary to send out newsletters and other information (i.e. Names, email, membership status, etc.)
